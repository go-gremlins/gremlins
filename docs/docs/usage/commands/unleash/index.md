# Unleash

The main command used in Gremlins is `unleash`, that _unleashes_ the _gremlins_ and starts a mutation test of your code.
If `unleash` is too long to type for you, you can use its aliases `run` and `r`.

To execute a mutation testing run just type

```shell
gremlins unleash
```

If the module build requires tags

```shell
gremlins unleash --tags "tag1,tag2"
```

## Flags

`unleash` supports several flags to fine tune its behaviour.

### Arithmetic base

:material-flag: `--arithmetic-base` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `true`

Enables/disables the [ARITHMETIC BASE](../../mutations/arithmetic_base.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --arithmetic-base=false
```

### Conditionals-boundary

:material-flag: `--conditionals-boundary` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `true`

Enables/disables the [CONDITIONALS BOUNDARY](../../mutations/conditionals_boundary.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --conditionals_boundary=false
```

### Conditionals negation

:material-flag: `--conditionals-negation` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `true`

Enables/disables the [CONDITIONALS NEGATION](../../mutations/conditionals_negation.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --conditionals_negation=false
```

### Cover packages

:material-flag: `--coverpkg` · :material-sign-direction: Default: empty

Apply coverage analysis in each test to packages matching the patterns.
The default is for each test to analyze only the package being tested.

```shell
gremlins unleash --coverpkg "./internal/...,./pkg/..."
```

### Dry run

:material-flag:`--dry-run`/`-d` · :material-sign-direction: Default: false

Just performs the analysis but not the mutation testing.

```shell
gremlins unleash --dry-run
```

### Increment decrement

:material-flag: `--increment-decrement` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `true`

Enables/disables the [INCREMENT DECREMENT](../../mutations/increment_decrement.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --increment-decrement=false
```

### Integration mode

:material-flag:`--integration`/`-i` · :material-sign-direction: Default: false

In _normal mode_, Gremlins executes only the tests of the packages where the mutant is found.
This is done to optimize the performance, running less test cases for each mutation.

The drawback of this approach lies in the fact that if a mutation in a package influences the tests
of another package, this is not caught by Gremlins. In general, this is an acceptable drawback
because packages should rely on their own tests, not on the tests of other packages.

Nonetheless, there may be cases where you may want to run all the test suite for each mutation, for
example if you are analysing integration or E2E tests. In this scenario, you can enable _integration mode_.
However, you should be aware that integration mode is generally much slower, and you can also get
slightly different results depending on your test suite.

```shell
gremlins unleash --integration
```

### Invert assignments

:material-flag: `--invert-assignments` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `false`

Enables/disables the [INVERT ASSIGNMENTS](../../mutations/invert_assignments.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --invert-assignments
```

### Invert bitwise

:material-flag: `--invert-bitwise` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `false`

Enables/disables the [INVERT BITWISE](../../mutations/invert_bitwise.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --invert-bitwise
```

### Invert logical operators

:material-flag: `--invert-logical` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `false`

Enables/disables the [INVERT LOGICAL](../../mutations/invert_logical.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --invert_logical
```

### Invert loop control

:material-flag: `--invert-loopctrl` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `false`

Enables/disables the [INVERT LOOP](../../mutations/invert_loop.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --invert-loopctrl
```

### Invert negatives

:material-flag: `--invert-negatives` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `true`

Enables/disables the [INVERT NEGATIVES](../../mutations/invert_negatives.md) mutant type.

```shell
gremlins unleash --invert_negatives=false
```

### Output

:material-flag: `--output`/`-o` · :material-sign-direction: Default: empty

When set, Gremlins will write the give output file with machine readable results.

```shell
gremlins unleash --output=output.json
```

The output file in JSON format and has the following structure:

[//]: # (@formatter:off)

```json
{
  "go_module": "github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins",
  "test_efficacy": 82.00,
  //(1)
  "mutations_coverage": 80.00,
  //(2)
  "mutants_total": 100,
  "mutants_killed": 82,

        }
      ]

}
```

1. This is a percentage expressed as floating point number.
2. This is a percentage expressed as floating point number.
3. NOT VIABLE mutants are excluded from all the calculations.
4. The elapsed time is expressed in seconds, expressed as floating point number.

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
!!! warning
The JSON output file is not _pretty printed_; it is optimised for machine reading.

[//]: # (@formatter:on)

### Tags

:material-flag: `--tags`/`-t` · :material-sign-direction: Default: empty

Sets the `go` command build tags.

```shell
gremlins unleash --tags "tag1,tag2"
```

### Test CPU

:material-flag: `--test-cpu` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `0`

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
!!! tip
To understand better the use of these flag, check [workers](workers.md)
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

This flag overrides the number of CPUs the Go test tool will utilize. By default, Gremlins doesn't set this value.

```shell
gremlins unleash --test-cpu=1
```

### Threshold efficacy

:material-flag: `--threshold-efficacy` · :material-sign-direction: Default: 0

When set, it makes Gremlins exit with an error (code 10) if the _test efficacy_ threshold is not met. By default it is
zero, which
means Gremlins never exits with an error.

The _test efficacy_ is calculated as `KILLED / (KILLED + LIVED)` and assesses how effective are the tests.

```shell
gremlins unleash --threshold-efficacy 80
```

### Threshold mutant coverage

:material-flag: `--threshold-mcover` · :material-sign-direction: Default: 0

When set, it makes Gremlins exit with an error (code 11) if the _mutant coverage_ threshold is not met. By default
it is zero, which means Gremlins never exits with an error.

The _mutant coverage_ is calculated as `(KILLED + LIVED) / (KILLED + LIVED + NOT_COVERED)` and assesses how many mutants
are covered by tests.

```shell
gremlins unleash --threshold-mcover 80
```

### Timeout coefficient

:material-flag: `--timeout-coefficient` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `0`

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
!!! tip
To understand better the use of these flag, check [workers](workers.md)
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

Gremlins determines the timeout for each Go test run by multiplying by a coefficient the time it took to perform the
coverage run.
It is possible to override this coefficient (`0` means use the default).

```shell
gremlins unleash --timeout-coefficient=3
```

### Workers

:material-flag: `--workers` · :material-sign-direction: Default: `0`

[//]: # (@formatter:off)
!!! tip
    To understand better the use of these flag, check [workers](workers.md)
[//]: # (@formatter:on)

Gremlins runs in parallel mode, which means that more than one test at a time will be performed, based on the number of
CPU cores available.

By default, Gremlins will use all the available CPU cores of, and , in _integration mode_, it will use half of the
available CPU cores.

The `--workers` flag allows to override the number of CPUs to use (`0` means use the default).

```shell
gremlins unleash --workers=4
```
