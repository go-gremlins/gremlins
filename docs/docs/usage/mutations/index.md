# About Mutations

Mutations are the core of Gremlins' activity. Each mutation belongs to a group that defines its _flavour_. These
groups are called _mutation types_. Gremlins supports various _mutation types_, each comprising one or more mutations.

When Gremlins scans the source code under test, it looks for mutations and for each found mutation creates a _mutant_.
A _mutant_ is the "gremlin" that actually changes the source code.

Each _mutant type_ can be enabled or disabled, and only a subset of mutations is enabled by default.
